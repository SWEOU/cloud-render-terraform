2.	An Azure virtual network (VNet) with following subnets
  a.	Render Subnet (for render clients)
  b.	FastCache Subnet (for Avere vFXTs)
  c.	Management Subnet (for jump hosts)
  d.	Gateway Subnet (for VPN/ExpressRoute connectivity)
3.	Three Network Security Groups with basic rules
4.	A jump host for management / administration / Fast Cache build
5.	A VM Scale Set using the a Ubuntu based custom managed image which takes following inputs:
a.	Resource group & location for render clients
b.	VM size for Scale Set
c.	Capacity â€“ No. of VMs to build
d.	Name of the Scale Set
e.	Admin user and password
